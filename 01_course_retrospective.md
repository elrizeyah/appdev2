## 1. What went well
- I felt most confident when working on the **final semester topics**. I realized that the lessons were not as difficult as I initially imagined. My nervousness and tendency to overthink made the tasks seem more challenging than they actually were.  
- I have developed confidence in **designing systems**. I am able to create layouts and replicate design concepts effectively for projects. This skill allowed me to contribute both creatively and practically to development tasks.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- One of the most challenging tasks was **deploying the system to run properly**. Ensuring that the application functions without bugs required careful attention. I learned that deployment demands technical focus and consistent testing.  
- At the beginning, I struggled with **focus due to personal mental challenges**. This made it hard to concentrate and caused feelings of fear and uncertainty. Over time, I learned to manage my focus better and continued to do my best.

## 3. Key Learnings
- One of the main takeaways from the **web development portion of the course** was learning the clear difference between **HTML** and **JavaScript**. **HTML** is mainly used for **structuring web content**, while **JavaScript** is responsible for adding **interactivity and functionality**. Understanding how these two work together helped me better grasp how **websites function**.
- From a **technical perspective**, I improved my **coding and problem-solving skills** through **consistent practice** and **active participation** in tasks. Putting **genuine effort** into my work allowed me to produce more **accurate and efficient results**. In terms of **soft skills**, **clear communication** helped me better understand **project requirements** and collaborate more effectively with my teammates.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I want to focus more on **UI/UX development using Figma**. I am excited to improve my skills and apply them in more complex projects. Strengthening this skill will allow me to build better, more interactive user interfaces.  
- I need to be more proactive in **understanding and resolving issues** within assigned tasks. Diving deeper into my responsibilities will help me contribute more effectively. Being open to feedback and suggestions will also enhance my teamwork and performance.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

- My goal is for our team to successfully **deploy a functional mobile application**. I want the system to run more effectively compared to our experience last semester. Achieving this would demonstrate growth in both technical skills and teamwork.  
- The support I need most is **honesty with myself about my strengths and weaknesses**. Motivation from our instructor encourages me to keep improving and stay curious. Understanding that growth comes from practice and curiosity helps me stay engaged even when tasks are challenging.
